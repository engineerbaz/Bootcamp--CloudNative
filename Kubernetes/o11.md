# NFS

How to create NFS Server in CentOS
**Run these commands in Server Machine
Step 1: sudo su -
Step 2: yum install nfs-utils
Step 3: Create a directory anywhere you want using the "mkdir" command.
Step 4: Give the directory read/write permissions using the "chmod +rw <path-to-directory>
For Example.. "chmod +rw /home/aareez/nfs-server"
Step 5: Start the NFS Services using the command mentioned below.

systemctl enable rpcbind
systemctl enable nfs-server
systemctl enable nfs-lock
systemctl enable nfs-idmap
systemctl start rpcbind
systemctl start nfs-server
systemctl start nfs-lock
systemctl start nfs-idmap

Step 6: Edit the nfs server exports file using "nano /etc/exports" and Insert the directory path that you've created earlier. And give it the IP access, read and write permissions.
For example: 
/home/aareez/nfs-server    192.168.122.20(rw)
To make it accessable from a specific IP Address               -OR-    
/home/aareez/nfs-server    *(rw)   
To make it accessable from all IP Addresses

Step 7: Now Restart the NFS Service using the "systemctl restart nfs-server"

Step 8: Make sure to disable firewall OR If you're in a production enviroment just allow the port 2049/tcp

Step 9: Install net-utils using "yum install net-utils" commands.

**Now the NFS server is ready**

How to access the NFS from a Client Machine?
Step 1: Make sure you're logged-in as a root user. (sudo su -)
Step 2: Install NFS-Kernel-Server using "apt install nfs-kernel-server" (If you're using debian based distro) OR "yum install nfs-kernel-server" (If you're using Redhat Based Linux for example.. CentOS, Fedora, etc..)
Step 3: Now test if the Storage is accessable from the Client Device using "showmount -e "server-ip-address"
For Example: 
showmount -e 192.168.122.20
The output should look something like this:



++++++++Client

sudo apt update
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
